Good question â€” let's make it super clear so you're never stuck on this again! ðŸ§ âœ¨

Running your server = running your `backend/app.py`.

Here's exactly how you restart it step-by-step:

# ðŸ›  How to Run Your Flask Server (Simple Version)

1. **Open VS Code** (or your code editor you're using).
2. **Open a Terminal** (Terminal â†’ New Terminal) inside VS Code.

âœ… Make sure you see something like this at the bottom:
```
PS C:\Users\artman\Desktop\open-door\backend>
```

*(You want to be inside the `backend/` folder where `app.py` lives.)*

---

3. **Run this command:**

```bash
python app.py
```

âœ… If everything works, youâ€™ll see:

```
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
* Press CTRL+C to quit
```

That means your server is *alive* and waiting for your frontend to connect! ðŸš€

# ðŸ“œ Important Notes

- If you already had an old terminal window open where the server was running, **make sure you stopped it first** (press `Ctrl+C` inside that terminal).
- Then run `python app.py` again.

âœ… You always want to have **only one server running at a time**.

# ðŸŽ¯ Quick Shortcut Checklist:
| Action | Command |
|:-------|:--------|
| Go to backend folder | `cd C:\Users\artman\Desktop\open-door\backend` |
| Start server | `python app.py` |
| Stop server | `Ctrl+C` |
| Start again after editing | `python app.py` |

# ðŸ§¡ Why You Have to Run the Server

Because your **frontend (index.html)** sends **requests** to your **backend**.  
If the server isnâ€™t running, the frontend wonâ€™t be able to send or fetch anything.

---

# ðŸš€ So Right Now:

ðŸ‘‰ Open Terminal in VS Code  
ðŸ‘‰ Go to `backend/` if needed  
ðŸ‘‰ Run:

```bash
python app.py
```

âœ… Then keep that window open (don't close it).  
âœ… Now you can test your frontend "Read Messages" feature!
