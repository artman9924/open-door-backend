- 📅 **Roadmap Features Coming Soon:**

  - Mobile polish
  - Emotion tagging
  - Anonymous replies

Open Door was created to support human mental health with intentional design, ethical development, and a mission to build safe digital spaces.

|----------|----------------------------|
| Backend  | Flask (Python)             |
| Frontend | HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS      |

## ✨ Highlights

- 🔄 REST API with Flask + JSON handling
- 🧩 SQLite DB with auto-init and timestamps
- 🧪 Error handling, flag system, admin-only access

## 🐞 Debugging Lessons

- Missed `get_json()` → backend crash
- Wrong IP in fetch → broken deploy
- Forgot CORS → failed cross-origin calls
- Logging undefined vars → 500 error
- Git commit editor confusion → fix with `git config core.editor notepad`
